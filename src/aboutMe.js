                privately by the Ayala Foundation. This six-storey edifice houses ethnographic and archaeological exhibits on Filipino culture, art, and history. Since its establishment 
                in 1967,[2] the museum has been committed to showcasing overseas collections and situating contemporary Philippine art in the global arena in a two-way highway of mutual cooperation 
                and exchange with local and international associates.[3]<br /><br />Envisioned during the 1950s by Philippine abstract painter Fernando ZÃ³bel de Ayala y Montojo, as a museum of Philippine 
                history and iconography, the Ayala Museum was established in 1967 as a project of the Filipinas Foundation, now known as the Ayala Foundation.[2] The museum was housed at the Insular 
                Life Building and was transferred to[4] the old Makati Stock Exchange 
                Building.[5] The old building was designed by National Artist Leandro Locsin.[4]
